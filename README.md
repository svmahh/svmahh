      <b>Modding</b><br />
      Modding Detroit is notoriously difficult due to a lack of documentation. I learned about <b>low-level computing</b> by analyzing raw hex code and reverse-engineering file structures to create my own mods.
      I also started modding Cyberpunk recently, I am working on a custom player head mesh.

      <b>C# Binary Analysis Tool</b><br />
      I wrote this tool in C# to parse the game's <code>.idx</code> (index) files. It analyzes the binary data to determine entry counts and types—essentially building my own file extractor from scratch.
      I am currently researching decompression techniques and entropy analysis , to start unpacking game files.
